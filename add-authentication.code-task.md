# Task: Add Authentication to QWords Game

## Description
Implement user authentication functionality to allow users to create accounts, log in, and track their game progress over time. This will replace the current anonymous-only system with persistent user sessions.

## Background
The QWords application currently only supports anonymous users, which means players cannot track their progress, save their game history, or maintain statistics across sessions. Adding authentication will enable personalized experiences and progress tracking.

## Technical Requirements
1. Implement user registration with email and password
2. Create secure login/logout functionality
3. Add session management for authenticated users
4. Create user profile pages to display game statistics
5. Implement password reset functionality
6. Add user progress tracking and game history storage
7. Ensure secure password hashing and storage

## Dependencies
- Database schema updates to support user accounts
- Session management system (cookies/JWT tokens)
- Email service for password reset functionality
- Frontend authentication forms and user interface updates

## Implementation Approach
1. Create user model with secure password hashing
2. Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, logout)
3. Add middleware for session management
4. Create user profile and statistics tracking
5. Update frontend with authentication forms
6. Add protected routes for authenticated features

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **User Registration**
   - Given a new user provides valid email and password
   - When they submit the registration form
   - Then a new account is created and they are logged in

2. **User Login**
   - Given an existing user provides correct credentials
   - When they submit the login form
   - Then they are authenticated and redirected to the game

3. **Session Management**
   - Given a user is logged in
   - When they navigate between pages
   - Then their session persists without re-authentication

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Given an authenticated user completes a game
   - When the game ends
   - Then their statistics are updated and saved to their profile

5. **Password Security**
   - Given a user creates an account
   - When their password is stored
   - Then it is properly hashed and never stored in plain text
