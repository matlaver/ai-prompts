# Task: Update QWords Application to Java 17

## Description
Upgrade the QWords application from its current Java version to Java 17 to take advantage of modern language features, improved performance, and long-term support. This includes updating dependencies, build configurations, and ensuring compatibility.

## Background
The application is currently running on an older version of Java. Java 17 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release that provides better performance, security updates, and modern language features that can improve code maintainability and developer productivity.

## Technical Requirements
1. Update Java runtime version to Java 17 in all environments
2. Update build configuration (Maven/Gradle) to target Java 17
3. Update all dependencies to versions compatible with Java 17
4. Resolve any compilation issues or deprecated API usage
5. Update Docker configurations to use Java 17 base images
6. Update CI/CD pipeline to use Java 17 for builds and tests
7. Verify all existing functionality works with Java 17

## Dependencies
- Development environment Java 17 installation
- Updated IDE configuration for Java 17
- CI/CD pipeline updates for Java 17 support
- Production environment Java 17 deployment capability

## Implementation Approach
1. Update build files (pom.xml/build.gradle) to specify Java 17
2. Update Docker base images to Java 17
3. Resolve dependency compatibility issues
4. Fix any deprecated API usage or compilation errors
5. Update CI/CD pipeline configuration
6. Run comprehensive testing to ensure compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Given the build configuration is updated
   - When the project is compiled
   - Then it successfully builds using Java 17

2. **Dependency Compatibility**
   - Given all dependencies are updated
   - When the application starts
   - Then all libraries load without version conflicts

3. **Functionality Preservation**
   - Given the Java 17 upgrade is complete
   - When existing tests are run
   - Then all tests pass without modification

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Given the pipeline is updated for Java 17
   - When code is committed
   - Then builds and deployments succeed using Java 17

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Given the application is deployed with Java 17
   - When users access the application
   - Then all features work as expected with improved performance
