# Task: Add Guess History Display to QWords Game

## Description
Implement a visual history feature that shows players all their previous guesses during the current game session. This will help players track their attempts and make more informed subsequent guesses.

## Background
Currently, the QWords game does not display a history of guessed words, making it difficult for players to remember what they have already tried. This feature will improve the user experience by providing a clear record of all attempts within the current game.

## Technical Requirements
1. Create a guess history component to display previous attempts
2. Store guesses in memory during the current game session
3. Display guesses with visual indicators (correct, partial, incorrect)
4. Show the history in chronological order (most recent first or last)
5. Clear history when a new game starts
6. Ensure history is responsive and fits well in the game interface
7. Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## Dependencies
- Frontend state management for storing guess history
- UI components for displaying guess results
- Game state integration to track current session
- Styling updates to accommodate history display

## Implementation Approach
1. Add guess history state management to the game component
2. Create a history display component with proper styling
3. Update guess submission logic to add entries to history
4. Implement visual feedback for each guess result
5. Add game reset functionality to clear history
6. Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Guess Storage**
   - Given a player makes a guess
   - When they submit their word
   - Then the guess is added to the visible history

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Given a guess has been made
   - When it appears in the history
   - Then it shows correct letters in green, partial matches in yellow, and incorrect in gray

3. **History Ordering**
   - Given multiple guesses have been made
   - When viewing the history
   - Then guesses are displayed in chronological order

4. **Game Reset**
   - Given a player starts a new game
   - When the game resets
   - Then the guess history is cleared

5. **Responsive Display**
   - Given the history contains multiple guesses
   - When viewed on different screen sizes
   - Then the history remains readable and properly formatted
